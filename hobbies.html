     <h1>Ratan Tata Hobbies</h1>
<p>Ratan Tata, the esteemed Indian industrialist and philanthropist,
     had a diverse range of hobbies that reflected his multifaceted personality. 
     He was a skilled pilot and, in 2007, became the first Indian to fly the F-16 Falcon.
      His love for music, particularly jazz and Western classical, was evident in his piano playing.
      An avid art enthusiast, Tata enjoyed painting and had a keen interest in automobiles,
       boasting a collection that included models like the Ferrari California and Jaguar F-Type.
        His deep affection for dogs led him to establish a kennel for strays at Bombay House, Tata Groupâ€™s headquarters. </p>
